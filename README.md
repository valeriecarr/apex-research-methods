The aim of the Applied Programming Experiences (APEX) program is to provide lower-division students with programming experiences embedded into existing introductory statistics and biology courses. APEX modules involve interactive exercises in the Python programming language. All materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

**APEX for Research Methods**  
Although APEX modules aren't specifically desigend for research methods courses, we nonetheless see the value of using APEX statitstics modules in such courses given that training students in research methods necessitates knowledge of statistics. Our team has piloted the use of several APEX stats modules in research methods courses here at SJSU. Links to each of these modules can be found below, and we encourage you to explore the larger set of APEX stats modules [here](https://github.com/vectrlab/apex-stats-modules#readme).
